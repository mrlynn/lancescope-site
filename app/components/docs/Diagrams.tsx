/** Mermaid blocks in the guide, drawn.
 *
 *  Three things decide the shape of this.
 *
 *  It is the only part of the guide that runs in a browser. Everything else —
 *  markdown, front matter, syntax highlighting — happens once at build time and
 *  arrives as HTML. Mermaid cannot: laying out a graph needs real text measurement,
 *  which needs a real DOM, which at build time would mean shipping a headless
 *  browser as a build dependency. So it renders on the client, and only on the pages
 *  that have a diagram: `doc.diagrams` gates the import, and the import is dynamic,
 *  so a reader on a page with no diagram never fetches the library at all.
 *
 *  Its palette is read rather than declared. `getComputedStyle` on the document
 *  gives back whatever the theme currently resolves to, so a diagram is in key with
 *  the page around it in light and dark, and stays in key if the palette changes —
 *  without a second copy of the colours living here to drift out of step with
 *  globals.css.
 *
 *  A diagram that will not draw leaves its source on screen. The markdown ships the
 *  source inside the figure, so the failure case is the page as it looked before any
 *  of this existed, plus a line saying why. A blank space where a picture should be
 *  is the one outcome worth engineering against.
