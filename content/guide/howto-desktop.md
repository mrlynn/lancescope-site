# Build the macOS app

LanceScope builds as a real macOS application: a window with its own title bar,
running a server it starts and stops itself. Nothing needs installing on the machine
it lands on — no Python, no Node, no Lance.

## Build it

```bash
make app
```

Three stages, and the first two are the slow ones:

1. `make ui` exports the interface as static files
2. `make sidecar` freezes the server into one executable with PyInstaller
3. Tauri compiles a Rust shell and assembles `LanceScope.app` and a `.dmg`

The result is **433 MB installed, 160 MB as a DMG**. For comparison, MongoDB Compass
is 394 MB.

## What is inside, and what is not

The app carries the console — catalog, query, compare, findings, settings, and the
language layer, which reaches a model over HTTP rather than running one.

It does **not** carry torch or SigLIP. Those exist for the demo's semantic search, and
they are two gigabytes for one screen. So in a packaged build the demo lists its
corpus and refuses to search it, with a message saying why. Run from a checkout for
that.

## Why an app rather than the launcher

`LanceScope.command` is handed to your login shell, and whatever your shell does
first happens to the launch. A shell that reads from stdin during startup — an
oh-my-zsh update prompt, for instance — consumes the first character of the path
Terminal typed, and the launcher fails with `no such file or directory` before any of
its own code runs.

The app is executed by LaunchServices with no shell in the path at all. The launcher
remains for developers; it is not the supported way to run this.

## If the build cannot find cargo

`rustup` puts cargo on your PATH by editing shell startup files, so a script only
sees it if the shell that ran the script is one of the shells that got edited. Both
`desktop/build.sh` and `desktop/sign.sh` look for it themselves and check every tool
they need up front — a signing script that fails four minutes in because something is
missing has wasted four minutes and told you nothing it could not have said
immediately.

## Signing it

Put the credentials in a file rather than typing them — a password typed into a
terminal ends up in a history file. `.cred` in the repository root, which
`.gitignore` covers:

```bash
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)"
APPLE_ID=you@example.com
APPLE_TEAM_ID=TEAMID
APPLE_PASSWORD=abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
```

Then:

```bash
./desktop/sign.sh
```

**Assignments, not commands.** A file holding a `store-credentials` command line is a
note to yourself, not something the script can read, and it will say so rather than
silently proceeding without credentials.

Unsigned, macOS will refuse to open it on any machine but the one that built it. With
an Apple Developer account:

```bash
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
APPLE_ID=you@example.com \
APPLE_TEAM_ID=TEAMID \
APPLE_PASSWORD=your-app-specific-password \
./desktop/sign.sh
```

`APPLE_PASSWORD` is an **app-specific password** from appleid.apple.com under
Sign-In and Security — not your Apple ID password. It looks like
`abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop`. This is the single most common reason notarisation returns
`401 Invalid credentials`.

If you sign more than once, put the credentials in the keychain instead of in your
shell history:

```bash
xcrun notarytool store-credentials lancescope \
  --apple-id you@example.com --team-id TEAMID --password abcd-efgh-ijkl-mnop
```

```bash
NOTARY_PROFILE=lancescope \
APPLE_SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
./desktop/sign.sh
```

Either way the credentials are checked **before anything is built**. Apple answers a
`notarytool history` call in well under a second, and finding out a password is wrong
after a Rust compile, a 428 MB copy and a signature is four minutes spent learning
something that could have been said immediately.

The script builds, signs with the hardened runtime, verifies the signature before
spending a notarisation round trip, submits the DMG, waits, and staples the ticket so
the app opens offline on a machine that has never seen it.

### What signing proves, and what it does not

A signed build has been run and verified here: hardened runtime on
(`flags=0x10000(runtime)`), a full Developer ID chain to the Apple Root CA, all three
entitlements applied, `codesign --verify --deep --strict` clean, and — the part that
actually mattered — **the signed app launches and serves its tables**. That is the
step where a wrong entitlement shows up, and it passed.

Notarisation is a separate thing, and needs Apple's servers and your credentials.
Until an app is notarised and stapled it will run on the machine that built it and be
refused everywhere else.

### The entitlements, and why they are there

A hardened runtime blocks what PyInstaller needs. Python maps pages out of its
archive and some extensions write executable memory, so the app signs and notarises
cleanly and then **dies on launch with a code signature error** — the worst place to
discover it. Three entitlements prevent that: `allow-jit`,
`allow-unsigned-executable-memory` and `disable-library-validation`.

This is a Developer ID app rather than an App Store one, deliberately. Sandboxing
would mean a file-picker dance for a tool whose whole job is to read a directory
somebody typed the path of.
